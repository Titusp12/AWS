#### EFS
  * Note EBS can only be connected to one machine but EFS can be connected to multiple machine. 
  * You use EFS to copy some data to other servers
  * Go to EFS and create file system 
  * create a NFS inbound rule for port 2049 on EFS security group
  * you may follow up the amazon ec2 mount instructions (click link in file system UI) 
  * in opt/ mount -t nfs fs-2342342.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /opt/folder   (efs for linux, nfs for rhel and others)(DNS name is in UI)
  * run df -h  --you can see the file system attached
  * You must have same folder and run above 2 command on both machine. 
  * Whatever file you make on one machine under that folder will be reflected to another. 
  * SAN(Storage array network) --is like EBS
  * NAS(network attached storage) --is like EFS  (nfs is protocol)
  * now when you do reboot, you need to again mount it. But we have solution below.
  * vi /etc/fstab
  * on last line add one more 0, add below line just below it
  * fs-2342342.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com /opt/folder       nfs       defaults       0 0
  * 0 0 talks about backups and systemchecks
